Let children learn in a "family" with an atmosphere of inviting God's presence through unceasing worship and prayer!

A healthy and happy "family" to us is a place where we put God above everything else, where love and security abounds, and where our next generation can dream and shine. This "family" is very closely related to day and night worship and prayer, because this "family" is built up when a group of people will walk together in love and in His truth, and as they come together in unity to seek His presence. This is why we put the altar—worship and prayer as our first priority in the "family", so teachers, parents, students and volunteers can come together before God every day, and together we will nurture the following qualities and values:

1.Each life is beautiful, one of a kind, and precious 
We believe as our next generation experiences intimacy with God and real love, they will be satisfied in body, heart and soul; they will understand how beautiful and precious they really are, and be able to live out their God-created uniqueness.
<br><br>
2.Born to Create 
A "family" that is full of love and acceptance provides a sense of security that would allow our next generation to try different things because they know that they are well protected and that mistakes are allowed. As they draw near to the Creator and understand His will, they will receive heavenly inspiration (revelation) and unleash creativity beyond what we now know. We believe God has given us creativity not just for arts and media; when positive creativity is used in the family, city, and society, we can create a better culture and atmosphere to bring forth breakthrough and transformation. Therefore, children should discover and develop their creativity from a very young age so they would understand and recognize their own influence.
<br><br>
3.Become Excellent 
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." (Proverbs 9:10) 
<br><br>
We believe when children know Him as the source of wisdom, and learn to fear Him, they will be "excellent" like Daniel. Excellence should never be only displayed on an academic transcript or in competition ranking; our next generation will be built up in character as they know God, including boldness, righteousness, respect, love for others, humility, voluntariness, willingness to try new things, faithfulness, steadiness, intransigence etc., they will excel in talent and virtuousness and bring hope to the world. 
<br><br>
4.The Importance of teaching by example 
The best way to educate our next generation is to teach by example, with youth and adults who have been academically challenged and have gone through their own ups and downs in life as teachers and mentors, together they will walk and encourage one another to embrace what life has in store for them.This is why we commit to investing in the lives of teachers and training them professionally, so they would become role models to our next generation in their personal character, their attitude towards life, and the way they learn.
